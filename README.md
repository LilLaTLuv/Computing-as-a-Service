## Project One: ERD for YODAE

**Date:** October 13, 2024

This document presents an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) designed for YODAE's operational database. The ERD focuses on key entities such as:

* **Students:** Information related to students.
* **Teachers:** Information related to teachers.
* **Courses:** Information about the educational courses offered.
* **Enrollment:** The relationship between students and courses, tracking enrollment details and performance.
* **Devices:** The devices used by students and teachers and their associations.

The ERD illustrates the relationships between these entities, including one-to-many and many-to-many connections, aiming to support functionalities like student progress tracking, teacher assignments, and educational outcome analysis within YODAE's cloud-based system.

## Project Two: White Paper - IoT Security in Educational Environments

**Date:** October 27, 2024

This white paper addresses the security challenges associated with integrating innovative IoT devices into K-12 educational environments, as envisioned by YODAE. It provides an overview of potential IoT devices and their use cases, including:

* **Voice-Activated Personal Assistants (VPAs):** For hands-free information access and classroom management.
* **IoT Whiteboards:** For collaborative learning and interactive presentations.

The paper discusses the integration of IoT with cloud computing and highlights potential vulnerabilities and risks such as insecure default settings, lack of patching, data privacy breaches, and physical security risks.

Furthermore, it outlines a typical IoT architecture (Device, Network, and Application Layers) and proposes solutions to errors in IoT design, focusing on:

* **Confidentiality:** Implementing strong encryption.
* **Integrity:** Utilizing robust authentication methods.
* **Availability:** Implementing redundancy and failover mechanisms.

The white paper also touches upon the ethical and societal implications of IoT deployment in education, including student privacy, surveillance concerns, and the digital divide. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of addressing security and ethical considerations for the safe and effective integration of IoT devices in classrooms.
